# gogzip
An implementation of gzip in Go

This is not finished. I just started it. My goal with this is to improve my
knowledge of i/o, readers, writers, files, and compression.

This implementation will handle compression and decompression. I will have to
look closely at the original specification and decide what would make sense to
implement.
